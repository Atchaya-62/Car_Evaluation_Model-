# Car_Evaluation_Model-
A simple and interactive web application that predicts the acceptability of a car (Unacceptable, Acceptable, Good, or Very Good) based on six categorical features, using a Machine Learning classification model.  The app is built with Flask, uses Label Encoders for preprocessing, and loads a trained model using Joblib.
